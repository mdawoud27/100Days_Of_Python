## About

This repository documents my commitment to dedicate 100 days to improving my Python programming skills. Each day, I will work on coding exercises, projects, or challenges related to Python. The purpose of this challenge is to learn, practice, and have fun with Python.

## Projects

Throughout this challenge, I will be working on a variety of Python projects. These projects will cover different areas of Python programming, such as web development, data analysis, automation, and more. Check out the [Projects](Projects/) directory for detailed information about each project.

## Challenges

In addition to projects, I will take on coding challenges and exercises to strengthen my problem-solving abilities and deepen my understanding of Python. These challenges may range from simple coding tasks to more complex algorithmic problems. You can find the challenges and my solutions in the [Challenges](Challenges/) directory.

## Progress

I will update my progress regularly in the [Progress](Progress/) directory. Each day's progress will be documented, including the tasks I worked on, challenges I completed, and any new concepts I learned. This section will serve as a log of my journey through the 100 days of Python.

## Resources

Throughout this challenge, I will be using a variety of resources to learn and improve my Python skills. Some of the resources I will be referring to include:

- Online tutorials and courses
- Python documentation
- Coding platforms for challenges and exercises
- Books and articles on Python programming

Feel free to explore the [Resources](Resources/) directory for a curated list of the resources I find helpful.
